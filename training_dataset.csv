Appeals court says Mark Meadows can’t move Georgia election case charges to federal court,"ATLANTA (AP) — A federal appeals court on Monday ruled that former Trump White House chief of staff Mark Meadows cannot move charges related to efforts to overturn the 2020 election in Georgia to federal court.Meadows was indicted in August along with former President Donald Trump and 17 others on charges that they illegally conspired to keep the Republican incumbent in power despite him losing the election to Democrat Joe Biden.A three-judge panel of the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals rejected Meadows’ request, affirming a lower court ruling from September. The ruling is a win for Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis, who brought the case and is seeking to try the remaining defendants in a single trial.Meadows’ attorneys had argued that he should be allowed to move the case to federal court because his actions outlined in the indictment were directly related to his duties as a federal official. Prosecutors argued that Meadows failed to show any connection between his actions and his official duties and that the law allowing federal officials to move a case to federal court doesn’t apply to those who have left office.WATCH: How Meadows’ testimony in Georgia could help shape case against TrumpCircuit Chief Judge William Pryor wrote in Monday’s ruling that the law “does not apply to former federal officers, and even if it did, the events giving rise to this criminal action were not related to Meadows’s official duties.”Meadows was one of five defendants seeking to move his case to federal court. The other four were also rejected by the lower court and have appeals pending before the 11th Circuit.Moving Meadows’ charges to federal court would have meant drawing from a jury pool that includes a broader area than just overwhelmingly Democratic Fulton County. It would have also meant an unphotographed and televised trail, as cameras are not allowed inside. But it would not have opened the door for Trump, if he’s reelected in 2024, or another president to pardon anyone because any convictions would still happen under state law.Four people have already pleaded guilty in the Georgia election case after reaching deals with prosecutors. The remaining 15, including Trump, Meadows and former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani, have pleaded not guilty."
Actor Jonathan Majors found guilty of assaulting his former girlfriend in car in New York,"NEW YORK (AP) — Jonathan Majors was convicted Monday of assaulting his former girlfriend after a two-week trial that the actor hoped would salvage his damaged reputation and restore his status as an emerging Hollywood star.A Manhattan jury found Majors, 34, guilty of one misdemeanor assault charge and one harassment violation. He was also acquitted of a different assault charge and of aggravated harassment. Majors, who was asked to stand and face the jurors as the verdict was read, showed no immediate reaction, looking slightly downward.His sentencing was set for Feb. 6. He faces up to a year in jail on the harassment charge.The charges stemmed from a dispute between the “Creed III” actor and his girlfriend, Grace Jabbari, that began in the backseat of a chauffeured car and spilled into the streets of Manhattan one night last March.Jabbari, a 30-year-old British dancer, accused Majors of an attack inside the vehicle that left her in “excruciating” pain. She said he struck her in the head with his open hand, twisted her arm behind her back and squeezed her middle finger until it fractured.Majors’ lawyers said she was the aggressor, alleging that she flew into a jealous rage after reading a text message on his phone sent by another woman. They said Jabbari had spread a “fantasy” to take down the actor, who was only trying to regain his phone and get away safely.The verdict dealt a major blow to Majors, who was on the verge of Hollywood stardom until his arrest in March sent his career into a tailspin.READ MORE: ‘Apollo 13’ and ‘12 Years a Slave’ among 25 films picked for National Film Registry preservationOnce slated to lead the next phase of the Marvel universe as the supervillain Kang the Conqueror, Majors faced an uncertain future with the lucrative franchise after the abuse charges. The actor, who attended the Yale School of Drama, has lost other parts and endorsement deals and seen his critically-acclaimed drama, “Magazine Dreams,” pulled from its scheduled release earlier this month.Majors arrived in the courtroom each morning carrying a gold-leaf Bible, offering hugs to his family members and his current girlfriend, actress Meagan Good, before taking his seat. Expressionless for much of the testimony, he wiped away tears as his attorney, Priya Chaudhry, urged jurors to “end this nightmare for Jonathan Majors.”But as Majors sought vindication from the jury, the trial also brought forth new evidence about his troubled relationship with Jabbari, whom he met on the set of “Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania” two years ago.Accusing Majors of a “cruel and manipulative pattern” of abuse, prosecutors shared text messages that showed the actor begging Jabbari not to seek hospital treatment for an earlier head injury. One message warned “it could lead to an investigation even if you do lie and they suspect something.”They also played audio of Majors declaring himself a “great man,” then questioning whether Jabbari could meet the high standards set by the spouses of Martin Luther King Jr. and Barack Obama. Majors’ attorneys countered that Jabbari had surreptitiously recorded her boyfriend as part of her plot to “destroy” his career.Over four days of tearful testimony, Jabbari said Majors was excessively controlling and prone to fits of explosive rage that left her afraid “physically quite a lot.” She broke down on the witness stand as a jury watched security footage from the aftermath of the backseat confrontation, which prosecutors said showed Majors “manhandling” her and shoving her back in the car “as if she was a doll.”Majors did not take the stand. But Chaudhry said her client was the victim of “white lies, big lies, and pretty little lies” invented by Jabbari to exact revenge on an unfaithful partner.The attorney cited security footage, taken immediately after the shove, that showed Majors sprinting away from his girlfriend as she chased him through the night. Jabbari then followed a group of strangers she’d met on the street to a dance club, where she ordered drinks for the group and did not appear to be favoring her injured hand.“She was revenge-partying and charging Champagne to the man she was angry with and treating these strangers to fancy Champagne she bought with Jonathan’s credit card,” Chaudhry alleged.The next morning, after finding Jabbari unconscious in the closet of their Manhattan penthouse, Majors called police. He was arrested at the scene, while Jabbari was transported to a hospital to receive treatment for the injuries to her ear and hand.“He called 911 out of concern for her, and his fear of what happens when a Black man in America came true,” Chaudhry said, accusing police and prosecutors of failing to take seriously Majors’ allegations that he was bloodied and scratched during the dispute.In her closing arguments, prosecutor Kelli Galaway said Majors was following a well-worn playbook used by abusers to reverse the narrative by casting their victims as attackers.“This is not a revenge plot to ruin the defendant’s life or his career,” Galaway said. “You were asked why you are here? Because domestic violence is serious.”"
What you need to know about Scott Hall’s 2020 election charges,"Who was indicted alongside former President Donald Trump in the Georgia election case? Meet some of his co-defendants and read more about their specific charges.Republican poll watcher Scott Hall is shown in a police booking mugshot released by the Fulton County Sheriff’s Office, in Atlanta, Georgia, U.S. August 22, 2023. Fulton County Sheriff’s Office/Handout via REUTERSGeorgia bail bondsman Scott Hall was the first of 18 people indicted alongside Trump to plead guilty for participating in what prosecutors describe as a wide-ranging effort to overturn Georgia’s 2020 election results.He’s alleged to have helped remove election equipment and computer voting data from Coffee County, Georgia, alongside others like attorney Sidney Powell, who pleaded guilty in November.READ MORE: Read the full Georgia indictment against Trump and 18 alliesIn addition to Powell, attorneys Kenneth Chesebro and Jenna Ellis have also pleaded guilty to charges in this case.In September, Hall was the first co-defendant to plead guilty in Fulton County prosecutor Fani Willis’ case against former president Donald Trump and 17 other conspirators.He pleaded guilty to five counts of conspiracy to commit intentional interference with performance of election duties.Hall was sentenced to serve five years of probation, complete 200 hours of community service, pay a $5,000 fine and write an apology letter to the citizens of Georgia. He’s also forbidden from participating in polling and activities related to running elections, and agreed to testify truthfully in any further trials for this case.WATCH: Jenna Ellis pleads guilty over efforts in Georgia to overturn 2020 electionHall was originally charged on 7 counts:Prosecutors cited an email from Georgia Republican Party chair David Shafer that Hall had “been looking into the election on behalf of the President at the request of David Bossie,” as early as Nov. 20, 2020.In addition to various phone calls Hall made and received at the beginning of January 2021, which prosecutors do not explain in detail, Hall is largely indicted as part of the alleged effort to access and remove voter data and elections equipment from the Coffee County Board of Elections.WATCH: What Sidney Powell’s guilty plea means for Trump in his Georgia election subversion caseThe indictment alleges that Hall and others “aided, abetted and encouraged” employees of Sullivan Strickler, LLC to remove and examine voting data from Dominion Voting Systems, tamper with electronic ballot markers and tabulating machines, and remove official ballots from Coffee County polling locations in January 2021.Hall is a bail bondsman in Georgia and is the brother-in-law of David Bossie, who served as Trump’s deputy campaign manager in 2016.According to the Washington Post, Hall was chief executive of Anytime Bail Bonding, based in Augusta, Ga. In 2012, he was elected president of the Professional Bail Agents of the United States, a trade group representing his industry. He also lobbied for the Georgia Association of Professional Bondsmen in the state’s legislature, where he developed relationships with politicians.Hall believed the election had been tampered with, and used some of his networks to perpetuate his theories. Shafer connected Hall with Trump campaign staffers to share that he was “looking into the election,” and asked them for their cooperation and to exchange contact information with Hall. Hall then called Jeffrey Clark, a lawyer in the Justice Department who was also indicted in the scheme. The indictment identified a 63-minute phone call between Hall and Clark as part of the conspiracy, but did not include the details of the call."
"El-Sissi wins Egypt’s presidential election with 89.6 percent of the vote, secures third term in office","CAIRO (AP) — Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sissi, who has ruled with an unquestioned grip for the past nine years, won reelection to a third, six-year term in office, election authorities announced Monday. He ran against three virtually unknown opponents.El-Sissi recorded a landslide victory, securing 89.6 percent of the vote, the National Election Authority said. Turnout was 66.8 percent of more than 67 million registered voters.“The voting percentage is the highest in the history of Egypt,” declared Hazem Badawy, the election commission chief, who announced the official results in a televised news conference.The vote was overshadowed by the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza on Egypt’s eastern border, which has threatened to expand into wider regional turmoil.Egyptians voted “to express their rejection to this inhumane war,” el-Sissi said during a televised speech that followed the results announcement. Since the outbreak of the war, Cairo has accused Israel of trying to push Palestinians from Gaza into Egypt and quash Palestinian demands for statehood.The North African country is also in the midst of an economic crisis, with monthly inflation surging above 30 percent. Over the past 22 months, the Egyptian pound has lost 50 percent of its value against the dollar, with one third of the country’s 105 million people already living in poverty, according to official figures.WATCH: A look at Egypt’s struggles 10 years after soldiers killed hundreds in Rabaa massacreA key Western ally in the region, el-Sissi has faced international criticism over Egypt’s human rights record and harsh crackdown on dissent. A career army officer and defense minister at the time, he led the 2013 military overthrow of an elected but divisive Islamist president, Mohammed Morsi, amid widespread street protests against his one-year rule.El-Sissi was first elected as president in mid-2014, then reelected in 2018. A year later, constitutional amendments, passed in a general referendum, added two years to el-Sissi’s second term, and allowed him to run for a third, six-year term.His victory in this latest election was widely deemed a foregone conclusion — his three opponents were marginal political figures who were rarely seen during the election campaign.Hazem Omar, head of the Republican People’s Party, came in second with 4.5 percent of the vote, followed by Farid Zahran, head of the opposition Social Democratic Party with 4 percent. Abdel-Sanad Yamama, chairman of the Wafd Party, received less than 2 percent of the vote.An ambitious young presidential hopeful, Ahmed Altantawy, dropped out of the race after he failed to secure the required signatures from residents to support his candidacy. He was considered el-Sissi’s most credible opposition figure and said that harassment from security agencies against his campaign staff and supporters prevented him from reaching the voter threshold for candidacy.Ahead of the election, el-Sissi vowed to address Egypt’s ailing economy, without offering specifics.Experts and economists widely agree the current crisis stems from years of mismanagement and lopsided economy, where private firms are squeezed out by state-owned companies. The Egyptian economy has also been hurt by the wider repercussions of the coronavirus pandemic and the ongoing Russian war in Ukraine, which rattled the global market.El-Sissi’s government initiated an ambitious, International Monetary Fund-backed reform program in 2016, but the austerity measures sent prices soaring, exacting a heavy toll on ordinary Egyptians.Last December, the government secured a second IMF deal on the promise of implementing economic reforms, including a floating exchange rate. The cost of basic goods has since jumped, particularly of imports.Timothy Kaldas, deputy director of the Tahrir Institute for Middle East Policy in Washington, said a quick fix to the economy is highly unlikely. Inflation will remain high and investors weary, he said. “Without inclusive growth and investment, Egypt will never reach a stable footing.”Under el-Sissi’s watch, thousands of government critics have been silenced or jailed. They are mainly Islamists but also prominent secular activists and opposition figures, including many of those behind the 2011 uprising that toppled longtime autocrat Hosni Mubarak."
UN Security Council to vote on resolution urging cessation of hostilities in Gaza to deliver aid,"UNITED NATIONS (AP) — The U.N. Security Council delayed until Tuesday morning a vote on an Arab-sponsored resolution calling for a halt to hostilities in Gaza to allow for urgently needed aid deliveries to a massive number of civilians as members intensified negotiations to try to avoid another veto by the United States.The council said Monday’s 5 p.m. EST vote would not take place, and diplomats said negotiations were taking place to get the United States, Israel’s closest ally, to abstain or vote “yes” on the resolution.A key issue is how to implement and sustain a desperately needed aid operation. Human Rights Watch accused Israel earlier Monday of deliberately starving Gaza’s population by blocking the delivery of water, food and fuel, a method of warfare that it described as a war crime. The United Nations’ food agency reported on Dec. 14 that 56 percent of Gaza’s households were experiencing “severe levels of hunger,” up from 38 percent two weeks earlier.The draft on the table Monday morning called for an “urgent and sustainable cessation of hostilities” for humanitarian access to deliver aid. But this language is expected to be watered down to a “suspension” of hostilities or something possibly weaker to satisfy the Americans, the diplomats said, speaking on condition of anonymity because discussions have been private.READ MORE: Pressure mounts on Israel to renew cease-fire talks after killing of hostages raises alarm about its conduct in GazaThe U.S. vetoed a Security Council resolution on Dec. 8 that was backed by almost all council members and dozens of other nations demanding an immediate humanitarian cease-fire in Gaza. The 193-member General Assembly overwhelmingly approved a similar resolution on Dec. 12 by a vote of 153-10, with 23 abstentions.The importance of a Security Council resolution is that it is legally binding, but in practice many parties choose to ignore the council’s requests for action. General Assembly resolutions are not legally binding, but though they are a significant barometer of world opinion.The draft resolution that was being considered by the 15 council members on Monday recognizes that civilians in Gaza don’t have access to sufficient food, water, sanitation, electricity, telecommunications and medical services “essential for their survival.” Also, it would express the council’s “strong concern for the disproportionate effect that the conflict is having on the lives and well-being of children, women and other civilians in vulnerable situations.”More than 19,400 Palestinians have been killed according to the Gaza Health Ministry since Israel declared war on the Palestinian militant Hamas group following its surprise attack in southern Israel on Oct. 7 that killed about 1,200 people — mostly civilians — and took about 240 hostages.Hamas controls the Gaza Strip and its Health Ministry does not differentiate between civilian and combatant deaths. Thousands more Palestinians lie buried under the rubble in Gaza, the U.N. estimates. Israel says 116 of its soldiers have died in its ground offensive.READ MORE: Israel separating families in Gaza, taking men to undisclosed locations in mass arrest campaign, activists sayThe proposed council resolution reiterates its demand that all parties comply with international humanitarian law, especially protecting civilians and the infrastructure critical for their survival including hospitals, schools, places of worship and U.N. facilities.The draft, obtained by The Associated Press, demands the parties to the conflict — Hamas and Israel — fulfill their obligations under international humanitarian law and enable “the immediate, safe and unhindered delivery of humanitarian assistance at scale directly to the Palestinian civilian population throughout the Gaza Strip.”It “calls for an urgent and sustainable cessation of hostilities to allow safe and unhindered humanitarian access” in Gaza and also “firmly condemns all violations of international humanitarian law, including all indiscriminate attacks against civilians and civilian objects, all violence and hostilities against civilians, and all acts of terrorism.”The draft also demands the immediate and unconditional release of all Hamas-held hostages.The draft confirms its “unwavering commitment to the vision of the two-state solution,” and stresses “the importance of unifying the Gaza Strip with the West Bank under the Palestinian Authority.”The draft is being negotiated by the United Arab Emirates, which is the Arab representative on the Security Council, and requests U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres establish am expeditious mechanism to monitor all humanitarian shipments to Gaza by land, sea and air."
The European Union targets Russian diamond industry in latest round of Ukraine war sanctions,"BRUSSELS (AP) — The European Union said Monday that it has imposed fresh sanctions on Russia over its war against Ukraine, targeting the lucrative diamonds industry, more than 140 officials and organizations, and closing loopholes that Moscow has used to bypass previous punitive measures.It’s the 12th round of sanctions and restrictions that the EU has slapped on Russia since President Vladimir Putin ordered his troops into Ukraine almost two years ago. The measures have targeted the energy sector, banks, companies and markets, and made over 1,000 Russian officials subject to asset freezes and travel bans.EU headquarters said the latest measures would “deliver a further blow to Putin’s ability to wage war by targeting high-value sectors of the Russian economy and making it more difficult to circumvent EU sanctions.”The import, purchase or transfer of Russian non-industrial natural and synthetic diamonds and diamond jewelry will be banned starting Jan. 1. The ban applies to diamonds originating in Russia, exported from Russia and transiting through Russia, as well as Russian diamonds processed elsewhere.READ MORE: Putin vows no peace in Ukraine until Russia meets its unchanged military goalsThe EU estimates the diamond sector to be worth around $4.5 billion each year to Moscow.The new round of sanctions also obliges EU companies to prohibit in their contracts the export of certain goods so buyers can’t sell them on to Russia, particularly “sensitive goods and technology” that could be used by the Russian armed forces in Ukraine.Additional chemicals, lithium batteries, thermostats, certain electric motors that could be used in the manufacture of drones, and some machine tools and parts have been put on the EU’s list of restricted items banned for export to Russia.Imports into the EU of some goods that generate significant revenue for Russia also were tightened, including on copper and aluminum wire, foil, quantities of tubes and pipes above a certain limit, and restrictions on liquefied propane.The EU also added 29 more “entities” – often organizations, agencies, companies or banks – alleged to be supporting Russia’s military and industrial complex in the war against Ukraine. The entities and people whose assets have been frozen were not immediately named.The sanctions were expected to be published in the EU’s official journal shortly, which allows for them to formally enter force.The 27 EU countries will now consider imposing sanctions against people who benefit from the seizure of European assets or parts of companies in Russia. The member states will also come under tighter control to ensure they are actively tracing the assets of people targeted for sanctions."
North Korea resumes weapons testing with launch of long-range missile,"SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — North Korea on Monday conducted its first intercontinental ballistic missile test in five months, likely launching a developmental, more agile weapon, as it vows strong responses against U.S. and South Korean moves to boost their nuclear deterrence plans.The South Korean government described the missile tested as a solid-fueled weapon, a likely reference to the North’s road-mobile Hwasong-18 ICBM whose built-in solid propellants make its launch more difficult for adversaries to detect than liquid-fueled weapons. North Korean leader Kim Jong Un previously called the Hwasong-18 the most powerful weapon of his nuclear forces.WATCH: White House announces U.S., South Korea and Japan officials will meet to discuss North Korean threatSouth Korea’s military said the North Korean missile flew about 1,000 kilometers (620 miles) before landing in the waters between the Korean Peninsula and Japan. It said the missile was launched on an elevated angle, an apparent attempt to avoid neighboring countries. Japanese lawmaker Masahisa Sato, citing Japan’s Defense Ministry, said the missile rose as high as 6,000 kilometers (3,730 miles).The reported flight details matched those of North Korea’s second test of the Hwasong-18 missile in July. The North first test-fired the missile in April.Since 2017, North Korea has carried out a slew of ICBM tests in a bid to acquire the ability to launch nuclear strikes on the U.S. mainland. But all of its previous tests before April’s Hwasong-18 launch involved liquid-propellent ICBMs, which need to be fueled before launch and cannot stay fueled for long periods.U.S. national security adviser Jake Sullivan spoke with his South Korean and Japanese counterparts on the phone and condemned the North Korean launch as a violation of multiple U.N. Security Council resolutions that ban any ballistic activities by the North. South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol separately ordered officials to maintain a solid South Korean-U.S. joint defense posture and respond “swiftly and overwhelmingly” to any North Korean provocations against South Korea.The North’s ICBM test was its second weapons firing in less than a day. On Sunday night, it launched a short-range ballistic missile designed to strike South Korea that also splashed in the water off its east coast, according to its neighbors.Observers said the back-to-back launches were likely to protest announcements by South Korea and the United States that they will bolster their joint nuclear deterrence capabilities in the face of North Korea’s evolving nuclear threats.Senior U.S. and South Korean officials met in Washington on Friday for their second Nuclear Consultative Group meeting. They agreed to update their nuclear deterrence and contingency strategies and incorporate nuclear operation scenarios in their combined military exercises next summer, according to officials in Seoul.The consultative body is responsible for sharing information on nuclear and strategic weapons operation plans and joint operations, though the U.S. will retain operational control of its nuclear weapons. U.S. officials said the group’s establishment and other steps to solidify U.S. security commitment were meant to ease South Korean worries about North Korean provocations while keeping Seoul from pursuing its own nuclear program.North Korea’s Defense Ministry on Sunday called its rivals’ decision to include nuclear operation scenarios in their joint drills an open threat to potentially use nuclear weapons against the North. It said any attempt by enemies to use military force against North Korea will be met with “a preemptive and deadly counteraction.”Park Won Gon, a professor at Seoul’s Ewha Womans University, said North Korea’s latest ICBM launch was seen as an effort to improve its military capability to attack the U.S. mainland because it views the South Korea-U.S. nuclear deterrence strategy as a security threat.READ MORE: U.S. says North Korea delivered 1,000 containers of equipment and munitions to RussiaPark said the launch was also likely designed to boost Kim Jong Un’s military credentials at home ahead of a key ruling party meeting next week as he appeared to lack economic achievements.Since last year, North Korea has performed about 100 ballistic missile tests in what experts say is an attempt to enlarge its arsenal and wrest greater U.S. concessions. The U.S. and South Korea have responded by expanding their military drills and increased the temporary deployments of strategic U.S. assets such as aircraft carriers, nuclear-capable bombers and a nuclear-armed submarine in and near South Korea.Du Hyeogn Cha, an analyst at Seoul’s Asan Institute for Policy Studies, said North Korea is expected to continue weapons testing to pressure the U.S. to change its policy on the North.“No matter whether the Biden administration stays or steps out (of the White House) after the presidential election next year, North Korea will raise tensions on the Korean Peninsula to bring change of the U. S. government’s policy on it,” Cha said.Animosities between the Koreas further deepened after North Korea launched its first military reconnaissance satellite into space on Nov. 21 in violation of U.N. bans. South Korea, the U.S. and Japan strongly condemned it as an attempt by the North to improve its missile technology as well as establish a space-based surveillance system.The U.S., South Korea and Japan are pushing to put into operation the sharing of real-time missile warning data on North Korea within days, South Korea’s Defense Ministry said Monday. Ministry officials said the three countries closely shared their information about Monday’s launch.Meeting with reporters in Tokyo, Adm. John Aquilino, commander of the U.S. Indo-Pacific Command, expressed concerns about North Korea’s increasing missile capabilities. But he said that the United States, Japan and South Korea are working more closely than ever and that they were even ready for Monday’s launch and had mobilized their missile defense ships forward earlier this week.“The fact that we were able to predict a launch and then posture forces in advance that was pretty, pretty impressive,” Aquilino said, adding that it was not the first time but hard to do.Yamaguchi reported from Tokyo. Associated Press writer Jiwon Song contributed to this report."
EU investigates X over potential violations of social media law,"LONDON (AP) — The European Union on Monday made Elon Musk’s online platform X the first tech company to face an investigation under Europe’s tough new regulations designed to clean up social media and protect people from toxic online content.“Today we open formal infringement proceedings against @X” under the Digital Services Act, European Commissioner Thierry Breton said in a post on the platform formerly known as Twitter.READ MORE: IBM, EU and Lionsgate pull ads from X over concerns of antisemitic messagesThe 27-nation bloc is ratcheting up the pressure on X after asking the company in October for information on its handling of hate speech, misinformation and violent terrorist content related to the Israel-Hamas war. The case presents the first test for the Digital Services Act, part of a set of pioneering regulations that the EU has drawn up to rein in the power of tech companies.The European Commission, the EU’s executive branch, “will now investigate X’s systems and policies related to certain suspected infringements” of the DSA, spokesman Johannes Bahrke told a press briefing in Brussels. “It does not prejudge the outcome of the investigation.”The San Francisco-based social media platform says it is “committed to complying with the Digital Services Act, and is cooperating with the regulatory process. It is important that this process remains free of political influence and follows the law.”“X is focused on creating a safe and inclusive environment for all users on our platform, while protecting freedom of expression, and we will continue to work tirelessly towards this goal,” the company said in a statement.Musk has touted the platform as a place for free speech to thrive, but changes that the billionaire Tesla CEO made to the site after he bought it a year ago — such as cutting the number of content moderators and restoring the banned accounts of divisive public personalities — have turned off users and advertisers, who have fled over concerns about hate speech appearing alongside their ads.WATCH: Musk’s X is the largest source of disinformation, EU official saysThe EU’s investigation will look into whether X failed to do enough to curb the spread of illegal content — such as hate speech or incitement of terrorism — to its 112 million users in Europe.That includes the effectiveness of X’s tools for users to flag up illegal material in posts and ads so that it can be swiftly removed, as well as whether the company is following its own policies on restricting “sensitive content.”The investigation also will examine whether X’s measures to combat “ information manipulation,” especially through its crowd-sourced Community Notes fact-checking feature, were effective within the European Union.Another area of investigation is transparency. The EU said there are “suspected shortcomings” in researchers’ access to X’s publicly accessible data” as well as its ad database, both of which are required by the DSA.Lastly, the investigation will look into whether users are being tricked by suspected “deceptive design” of X’s interface, including for its blue check subscription service. The blue checkmarks once signified that the person or institution behind an account was genuine, such as a celebrity, athlete or journalist, but now merely indicate someone pays $8 a month to boost their posts above unchecked users.WATCH: Social media companies criticized as Israel-Hamas war misinformation spreads rampantlyThe EU has called out X as the worst place online for fake news, and officials have exhorted owner Musk to do more to clean it up.Now, it’s taking official steps under the Digital Services Act, a set of far-reaching rules designed to keep users safe online and stop the spread of harmful content that’s either illegal or violates a platform’s terms of service, such as promotion of genocide or anorexia.A raft of big tech companies faced stricter scrutiny after the DSA took effect earlier this year, threatening penalties of up to 6% of their global revenue — which could amount to billions — or even a ban from the EU.Fines are, however, considered a last ditch resort, and Brussels could first use “interim measures” to force companies to comply.There’s no deadline for a decision on the investigation into X, and the commission said it would continue to gather evidence, carry out interviews and conduct inspections."
